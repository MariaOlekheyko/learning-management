# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The 404 error occurs because asset paths in the built files are incorrect for GitHub Pages subpath deployment.

## Root Cause
- Repository: `MariaOlekheyko/learning-management`
- Expected URL: `https://mariaolekheyko.github.io/learning-management/`
- Built files had paths like `/assets/...` instead of `/learning-management/assets/...`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Enhanced GitHub Pages detection
- Fixed base path configuration for subpath deployment
- Added proper rollup options

### 2. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Added post-build step to fix asset paths
- Enhanced build verification
- Improved error detection

### 3. Manual Fixes Applied
- Fixed `dist/index.html` to use correct asset paths
- Added comprehensive testing page (`dist/test.html`)
- Created deployment verification scripts

### 4. Asset Path Corrections
**Before:** `/assets/index-DJEZ9H2z.js`
**After:** `/learning-management/assets/index-DJEZ9H2z.js`

## Next Steps Required

1. **Commit and Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment paths"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify GitHub Pages Settings**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Ensure source is set to "Deploy from a branch" → "gh-pages"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

3. **Test Deployment**
   - Access: `https://mariaolekheyko.github.io/learning-management/`
   - Test page: `https://mariaolekheyko.github.io/learning-management/test.html`

## Expected Result
After these changes, colleagues with GitHub access should be able to access the learning platform at:
`https://mariaolekheyko.github.io/learning-management/`

## Verification
The test page will show deployment status and help diagnose any remaining issues.
