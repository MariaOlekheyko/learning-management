# âœ¨ Learning Platform - Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **HTML Structure Fixed**
- Fixed malformed HTML in `index.html` with duplicate head/body tags
- Added proper meta tags and language attribute
- Removed duplicate CSS link that was causing issues

### 2. **Repository Configuration**
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use correct repository name: `learning-management`
- Added proper environment variable handling for GitHub Actions
- Configured proper base URL for GitHub Pages deployment

### 3. **CSS Import Structure**
- Simplified CSS imports in `main.tsx` to avoid conflicts
- Fixed duplicate imports that were causing build issues
- Ensured proper Tailwind CSS configuration

### 4. **Build Process Enhancements**
- Added build verification script
- Added debugging output to GitHub Actions workflow
- Improved error handling in deployment process

### 5. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Added proper environment variables for build process
- Enhanced debugging with build artifact listing
- Added build verification step

## Next Steps:

1. **Push changes to main branch** - This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Check GitHub Pages settings** - Ensure it's set to deploy from GitHub Actions
3. **Monitor the workflow** - Check Actions tab for any build errors
4. **Access the deployed site** - Should be available at: `https://marialekheyko.github.io/learning-management/`

## Troubleshooting:

If deployment still fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Verify repository settings have GitHub Pages enabled
3. Ensure the workflow has proper permissions
4. Check if the build verification script passes

The deployment should now work correctly with these fixes!
