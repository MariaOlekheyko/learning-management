# ✨ Learning Platform - Deployment Status

## ⚠️ Current Issue: GitHub Pages Asset Path Problem

The build process is working correctly, but there's an issue with asset paths in the GitHub Pages deployment. The current build is generating absolute paths (`/assets/`) instead of the proper GitHub Pages subdirectory paths (`/learning-management/assets/`).

## 🔧 Problem Analysis:

### Root Cause:
- The Vite build configuration needs to properly detect the GitHub Actions environment
- Asset paths must be relative to the repository subdirectory for GitHub Pages
- The build system should set `base: '/learning-management/'` for GitHub Pages deployment

### Current Build Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: PASSED
- ✅ Vite build: PASSED (6.01s)
- ✅ Assets generated: PASSED
- ❌ Asset paths: INCORRECT for GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Solution:

The deployment will work correctly once the GitHub Actions workflow runs with the proper environment variables:
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY=MariaOlekheyko/learning-management`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

When these are set, the Vite configuration will automatically generate the correct asset paths for GitHub Pages.

## 📊 Next Steps:

1. **Push Changes** - The updated Vite configuration is ready
2. **GitHub Actions Deployment** - The workflow will automatically set the correct environment variables
3. **Monitor Deployment** - Check the Actions tab for successful deployment
4. **Access Site** - Once deployed: `https://marialekheyko.github.io/learning-management/`

## 🛠️ Technical Details:

The issue is that the local build environment doesn't have the GitHub Actions environment variables set, so it builds with absolute paths instead of the GitHub Pages subdirectory paths. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically set these variables and generate the correct build.

The application includes:
- **Unified Learning Platform** with Microsoft, GitHub, and LinkedIn account integration
- **AI-powered Learning Assistant** for personalized recommendations
- **Progress tracking** and course management
- **Responsive design** with modern UI components

## 🔍 Expected Resolution:

Once the GitHub Actions workflow runs, the deployment should work correctly with proper asset paths.
