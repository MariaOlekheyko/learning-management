# How to Verify Deployment Status

## Quick Check List

1. **Check GitHub Actions Status**
   - Go to your repository → Actions tab
   - Look for latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Should show green checkmark for successful deployment

2. **Verify Site Access**
   - URL format: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`
   - Try accessing the site yourself
   - Share with colleagues to test access

3. **Test Site Functionality**
   - Page should load completely (no missing assets)
   - All buttons and navigation should work
   - Course enrollment and progress tracking should function
   - AI Assistant chat should be accessible

## Troubleshooting 404 Issues

### For Repository Owner
If you still get 404 errors:
1. Check repository settings → Pages
2. Ensure source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment completes
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### For Colleagues Getting 404s
1. **Repository Visibility**: Ensure repository is public or colleagues have access
2. **Correct URL**: Make sure they're using the right URL format
3. **GitHub Pages Settings**: Check if Pages is enabled for the repository
4. **Wait Time**: GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to propagate

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Assets Not Loading
**Symptoms**: Page loads but looks broken, missing styles
**Solution**: Assets paths have been fixed in the deployment workflow

### Issue: Navigation 404s
**Symptoms**: Clicking links within the app gives 404 errors
**Solution**: Added 404.html fallback for SPA routing

### Issue: Dependabot Errors
**Symptoms**: GitHub Actions showing Dependabot failures
**Solution**: Simplified dependabot.yml configuration

## Repository Settings to Verify

1. **Pages Configuration**:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch → `gh-pages` OR Deploy from GitHub Actions
   - If using GitHub Actions, ensure workflow has proper permissions

2. **Repository Visibility**:
   - Public repositories: Anyone can access GitHub Pages
   - Private repositories: Only collaborators can access

3. **Branch Protection**:
   - Ensure main branch allows GitHub Actions to run

## Current Status

✅ Fixed Dependabot configuration errors
✅ Fixed asset path issues for GitHub Pages
✅ Added SPA routing support (404.html)
✅ Dynamic repository name handling
✅ Proper .nojekyll file creation

The deployment should now work correctly for both you and your colleagues.
