# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Dependabot Configuration Error
**Problem**: Dependabot was trying to process packages in `/packages/spark-tools` directory causing errors.
**Fix**: 
- Removed the problematic package directory configuration from `.github/dependabot.yml`
- Changed update frequency from "daily" to "weekly" to reduce noise
- Kept only root directory npm package management

### 2. GitHub Pages Base Path Issues
**Problem**: Assets were not loading properly due to incorrect base paths in deployed version.
**Fix**:
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use actual repository name instead of hardcoded "learning-management"
- Modified deployment workflow to dynamically extract repository name from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
- Fixed asset path replacement in build process

### 3. 404 Error for Colleagues
**Problem**: Users with GitHub access getting 404 errors when visiting the deployed site.
**Fix**:
- Added proper 404.html fallback for single-page application routing
- Ensured .nojekyll file is created during deployment
- Updated deployment workflow to handle SPA routing properly

### 4. Deployment Workflow Improvements
**Fix**: 
- Made repository name dynamic in deployment process
- Added comprehensive verification steps
- Ensured proper GitHub Pages configuration

## Files Modified

1. `.github/dependabot.yml` - Simplified configuration
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Fixed asset paths and SPA routing
3. `vite.config.ts` - Updated default repository name

## Verification Steps

After deployment, the following should work:
1. Main site should load at `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`
2. All assets (CSS, JS) should load correctly
3. Navigation within the app should work without 404 errors
4. Colleagues with GitHub access should be able to view the site

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to trigger a new deployment
2. Check GitHub Actions for successful deployment
3. Test the deployed site URL
4. Verify with colleagues that the site is accessible

## GitHub Pages Settings

Ensure in your repository settings:
- Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- No custom domain is configured unless intended
- Repository visibility allows the intended audience
